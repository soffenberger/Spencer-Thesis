The validity of a Concept Inventory is imperative to its adoption by the education community. We analyze expert review and student performance data to evaluate the validity of the \gls{cci} for assessing student knowledge of core cybersecurity concepts after a first course on the topic. A panel of 12 experts in cybersecurity reviewed each item of the \gls{cci}, and the majority agreed that every item measured appropriate cybersecurity knowledge. We gave the \gls{cci} to 142 students from six different institutions taking a first cybersecurity course either online or proctored by the professor of the course. We used Classical Test Theory to evaluate the quality of the \gls{cci}. This evaluation showed that the \gls{cci} is sufficiently reliable for measuring students' knowledge of cybersecurity and that the \gls{cci} may be too difficult as a whole. We describe the results of both the expert review and the pilot test in further detail and provide recommendations for the continued improvement of the \gls{cci}.
